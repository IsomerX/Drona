			Hello readers, I am Sanya Jolly, I am 16 years old. I am currently studying spanish as an extra language for fun. I love reading and collecting books that fancy me. I love watching americal TV series and am currently watch suits, I have a keen interest in dogs too and have one named Daisy. This project was really fun to work on as it gave me a chance to learn new things about the structure of drones and how they can be so useful to us. I too strong agree that our heritage sites are precious and we should all engage together to make everyone aware about the beauty of these buildings. I do love visiting them and have visited couple of them, they are just lovely and give us a great insite on our history.<br>

				<h1 class="Dhruv">Dhruv Bakshi</h1>
			<p>Hey Guys, I am Dhruv Bakshi, The right one(if you had any doubts), I am your usual friendly neibourhood nerd. I have a huge interest in mathematics and computer programming, I love to play video games and is always enthusiastic about them. Am currently watching suits and really enjoying it. Hit me up if you have any math questions or just to play casual fortnite. This idea of a drone doing all this was hovering over in my head for a couple of months and I was planning to take it as a project of my own in college. This platform has given me a chance to display my idea and share it with the world. <br></p>
